My partner and I watch a lot of competitive climbing. I think I've seen
every [IFSC] boulder competition since 2017 or so and most lead climbing
competitions since 2020. It's fun to see people who share your hobbies
but are a million times better at them than you could ever realistically
hope to be! Mostly fun at least.

One thing we've noticed, or think we've noticed, is that, across the
men's and women's rounds, the boulder problems for the women climbers
look easier for them than the men's problems look for the men. [Matt Groom]
has also pointed out in broadcasts moves that the route setters assure
him are impossible, rests that don't exist, and heel hooks that are
supposed to be worthless, I think most often on women's climbs.
Janja Garnbret (the presumptive competitive climbing GOAT) has
[called for harder routesetting] for the women on several occasions,
and Staja Gejo [attributed a bad finals outcome] in Chamonix this year
to route setters' being men and all of the IFSC's routtesetters'
being men.

[Chamonix 2022] was a rare disaster -- four women topped the final wall,
so a performance that's normally good for first or second, for one of
the competitors, wasn't even enough for a podium. 

But how often do the route setters miss that badly? Do they disproportionately
set easier rounds for the women's category? Have there been recent changes
to relative difficulty? I wanted to know how well routesetters have done
working towards what I think their goals are (separate the climbers, have
"some but not too many" tops of the boulders) and whether there were differences
in how their boulder problems perform for the men's and women's events.

## The rules

### A bunch of words

Decent amount of climbing terminology in this post. Define top, boulder, zone, IFSC

### IFSC scorekeeping

explain scorekeeping

### Pre-registration

I doubt my eyes, I promise! It's tough to say and I probably have tons of recency bias.
All I've done so far is download a bunch of IFSC results, I haven't yet checked anything.
