I think I’ve seen\nevery <a href=\"https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/\">IFSC</a> boulder competition since 2017 or so and most lead climbing\ncompetitions since 2020. It’s fun to see people who share your hobbies\nbut are a million times better at them than you could ever realistically\nhope to be! Mostly fun at least.</p>\n<p>One thing we’ve noticed, or think we’ve noticed, is that, across the\nmen’s and women’s rounds, the boulder problems for the women climbers\nlook easier for them than the men’s problems look for the men. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mattgroom1/?hl=en\">Matt Groom</a>\nhas also pointed out in broadcasts moves that the route setters assure\nhim are impossible, rests that route setters have assured him don’t exist,\nand heel hooks that route setters have told him are supposed to be worthless.\nI think this happens most often on women’s climbs.\nJanja Garnbret (the presumptive competitive climbing GOAT) has\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/div/CgCrq1gDV3F/\">called for harder routesetting</a> for the women on several occasions,\nand Staja Gejo <a href=\"https://gripped.com/indoor-climbing/ondra-gold-overshadowed-by-contentious-separation-in-womens-final/\">attributed a bad finals outcome</a> in Chamonix this year\nto all of the IFSC’s routtesetters’ being men.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wIP_73GTYQ\">Chamonix 2022</a> was a rare mess — four women topped the final wall,\nso a performance that’s normally good for first or second, for one of\nthe competitors, wasn’t even enough to make the podium. </p>\n<p>But how often do the route setters miss that badly? Do they disproportionately\nset easier rounds for the women’s category? Have there been recent changes\nto relative difficulty? I wanted to know how well routesetters have done\nworking towards what I think their goals are\nand whether there were differences in how successful they are setting boulders\nfor men and women.</p>\n<h2>The rules</h2>\n<h3>IFSC scorekeeping</h3>\n<p>If you already watch a lot of IFSC competitions, you can skip this section. It exists to introduce\nIFSC scoring to someone who ends up on this blog post without a deep climbing background.</p>\n<p>The winner of an IFSC bouldering contest is determined, in order, by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>how many boulder problems each competitor reaches the top of (“tops,” for short)</li>\n<li>how many boulder problems each competitor reaches a specially marked “zone” hold of (“zones,” for short)</li>\n<li>how many attempts it took them in total for boulders they reached the top of (“topped”)</li>\n<li>how many attempts it took them in total to reach the zone for boulders they reached the zone hold of (“zoned”)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>tl;dr for scorekeeping in general: there rae two special holds per climb, you get points for reaching each of them,\nand it’s better to reach things in fewer attempts than more attempts.</p>\n<p>If two climbers finish tied across the values above, then the ranking is determined by “count-back”, which means\nuse the ranking from the previous round. If two climbers are tied in the previous round as well, e.g. in a final\nwhere the two climbers also tied in the semi-final, then the ranking is determined by count-back all the way back\nto the qualification round.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<h3>Pre-registration</h3>\n<p>With those rules in mind, there are a few things that commentators talk about the route setters trying to accomplish.\nWe can use those goals to come up with some definitions for more and less successful boulder rounds.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Boulders should <em>separate</em> the climbers. Most specifically, this means “count-back is a bad outcome.” More generally,\nit means that it’s best if rankings are determined by tops, next best if they’re determined by number of zones, next\nbest if they’re determined by attempts, and worst if they’re determined by count-back.</li>\n<li>The boulders shouldn’t be impossible. The field of climbers should be able to make progress in the four minutes\nthat climbers get for each boulder. There should be few boulders that no one tops, and fewer still boulders where no\none achieves the zone.</li>\n<li>The boulders shouldn’t be “too easy.” It’s hard to say what “too easy” means in general, but it’s easy to illustrate\nin extremes. A boulder that everyone in the field tops on their first try (“flashes”) is too easy. A boulder that half\nof the field flashes is probably also too easy. A boulder that one or two people flash is probably ok.</li>\n<li>Rounds should get progressively harder. In broad strokes this means top scores should be lower in semi-finals than\nqualification and lower in finals than semi-finals. Also, given that a boulder was topped or zoned, it should take\nmore attempts to get the top or zone in later rounds than earlier rounds.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So in the interest of statistical integrity, here are the questions I’d like to answer about men’s and women’s boulder\nrounds and whether the women regularly get different sorts of rounds from the men:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do the rounds tend to get harder? I don’t normally watch qualification and only sometimes watch semis.\nSix climbers make finals, so there are six climbers who have data for all three rounds. For those six climbers,\nif the rounds get harder, the overall top percentage should decrease, the overall zone percentage should decrease,\nattempts per top should increase, and attempts per zone should increase over the three rounds.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></li>\n<li>How often is making a semi-final or final determined by attempts? How often is making a semi-final or final\ndetermined by exactly one attempt? How often is count-back necessary, and for what ranks?<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup></li>\n<li>Do the answers to the previous two questions vary for the men’s and women’s events?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The point of choosing my questions in advance is that I don’t know the answers to any of these questions right now,\nso the questions can’t be cherry-picked to make a point. I’ll know soon though! Let’s begin.</p>\n<h2>Analysis</h2>\n<p>I downloaded IFSC results for every season from 2008 to 2022 (except 2021, which was mostly cancelled). I wrote a little <a href=\"https://github.com/jisantuc/ifsc-client/\">CLI program</a> to I download\nindividual seasons. For each season, I have a CSV with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">year</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">eventName</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">competitorName</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">rank</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">round</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">top</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">topTries</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">zone</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">zoneTries</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">competitionCategory</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Scripts for analyzing the questions above can be found in that program’s <a href=\"https://github.com/jisantuc/ifsc-client/tree/main/analysis\">analysis directory</a>.<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup></p>\n<h3>Route-setting goals: progression and difficulty</h3>\n<p>As a first check, it’s worth seeing whether rounds tend to get harder. There are a few ways to do this. The most obvious way\nis to check on top percentages. Intuitively, if a round has harder boulders, fewer climbers will reach the top of each boulder.\nBut we can’t <em>just</em> look at top percentages in each round — the climbers attempting the boulders in the qualification round\nare a different population from the climbers attempting the boulders in the final round, so it’s incorrect to compare the\nresults directly. Instead, we can filter to only those climbers who climbed in all three rounds and see how frequently they\nreached the tops of boulders. Looking at each year, rounds seem to get progressively harder.</p>\n<p>This plot<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup> shows, for each boulder event since 2008, the percentage of boulders that were topped in the final, semifinal, and\nqualification rounds:</p>\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n<img src=\"/d6a04b78c6e3a9820f86642195357b67/difficulty-top-percentage-round-event.svg\">\n</div>\n<p>If you squint a little, you can sort of see that finals are on average a bit harder than semis,\nand semis are a bit harder than qualification rounds.</p>\n<p>The trend is a more obvious if you look at the top percentage in each round by year, instead of\nfor individual events:</p>\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n<img src=\"/ee1fc083f75d8d5c929bb9f102669346/difficulty-top-percentage-round-year.svg\">\n</div>\n<p>There are other ways to measure difficulty. Instead of just focusing on tops,\nwe could look at the zone percentage, which should also decrease between\nrounds if boulders are getting harder. Or we could look at attempts for each\nsuccessful top or zone, which should <em>increase</em> across rounds if the boulders\nare getting harder. I checked those as well.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n<img src=\"/6ca403fa25e5f267856a65c5bf01a332/difficulty-alt-measures-round-year.svg\">\n</div>\n<p>On the left is zone percentage, which, like the top percentage, moves left as the rounds\nadvance. In the middle and on the right are attempts to reach each scoring opportunity,\nwhich moves right a bit as the rounds advance.</p>\n<p>These measures tell the same story as the top percentage. Overall, the\nroutesetters do a pretty good job of setting progressively more difficult rounds.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the general difficulty of the boulders looks pretty well calibrated! If all I told\nyou before you saw someone try a boulder was which round it was from and that the climber who would\nattempt it made the finals, you might guess that it’s about a coin flip whether they’d top it if it’s a\nfinals boulder, a little better than a coin flip if it’s a semis boulder, and pretty likely they’d top it\nif it’s a qualification boulder. The distributions for each round look challenging but not impossible.\nThere are outliers, but mostly, the top percentages are in a range I’d consider “reasonable.”<sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6</a></sup></p>\n<h3>Route-setting goals: separation</h3>\n<p>The other goal to check on is separation. There’s no such thing as “good” or “bad” separation in general,\njust better and worse. The importance of separation also isn’t constant over the course of a competition. If the difference\nbetween ranks 38 and 39 is one attempt to the zone hold, that’s not a big deal, since neither of those climbers is\nall that close to making the semi-final. If the difference between first and second in the final is one\nattempt to zone in the <em>semifinal</em>, that’s really bad! For each rank, I calculated how often each type of separation splits it from\nthe next rank.</p>\n<p>Over all of the finals in the dataset, that ends up looking like this:</p>\n<style

zones.\nThis looks like the route setters are pretty successful at setting boulders that separate the climbers\nbased on how they climbed in the round.</p>\n<p>How ranks are separated is also reasonably consistent over time.</p>\n<p>This plot shows for the top five ranks in finals and top six ranks in semis, how often they’re separated from\nthe next rank over all of the semis and finals within each year.\nWhile the proportion of each type of separation varies, the order of how often each occurs stays mostly the same.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n<img

On the women’s side, an efficient three tops and three zones\nin six attempts was good for… last place.</p>\n<p>When route setters have pushed the athletes, they’ve produced some incredible climbing moments.\nFor <a href=\"https://www.rockandice.com/climbing-news/ondra-hand-jams-his-way-to-gold-garnbret-tops-three-in-meiringen/\">Adam Ondra’s hand jam</a>, Ai Mori’s high foot in Koper last year,</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cugt-GBT9xg?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>and Yoshiyuki Ogata’s feet first method at Adidas Rockstars in 2019 (admittedly not an IFSC event),</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qIPZrwnQak?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>a part of what made the climbs so spectacular is how hard they were for everyone else in the round.\nFor someone to stand out that way, the boulders have to be hard enough to stop a lot of the field.</p>\n<p>So here’s my plea to routesetters. You’re weirdly good at assessing the relative difficulty of\ndifferent boulders, and I think if you wanted to you could produce women’s finals with scores like the men’s.\nSo don’t hold back! Let Janja<sup id=\"fnref-7\"><a href=\"#fn-7\" class=\"footnote-ref\">7</a></sup> cook! She and the rest of the top of the women’s field\nwill climb the boulders spectacularly, they’ll look really cool, you’ll look really cool by extension,\nand everyone else will get an amazing boulder season for both the men and women.</p>\n<p>Finals boulders have been relatively easy for the top women climbers for too long. Easier boulders and worse separation at the\ntop of the women’s field have required the top women to climb nearly perfectly to win. With harder boulders, we could\nsee them climb their best.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>  This actually happened in the Chamonix lead final mentioned above — several of the women climbers topped both the final lead route\nand the semi-final route. It’s very rare and a very bad outcome.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>  There’s likely to be some noise in the attempt data. With four minutes, climbers will have time for fewer attempts on a long, powerful boulder with the hard moves at the top than on a dynamic boulder with a low-percentage move right at the bottom. Rolling up to whole rounds mitigates that noise to an extent, because routesetters don’t set whole rounds of long powerful boulders or boulders with low percentage starting moves.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>  It’s subjectively less bad if count-back is necessary to separate fifth and sixth than it is if count-back determines third and fourth or first and second.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-4\">\n<p>  For everything in the program’s repo, you’ll be best off getting set up with <code class=\"language-text\">nix</code> to make sure you have identical versions to what I have.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5\">\n<p>  I think some of the off-alignment dots are for competitions that had the same name in the same year. For example, Salt Lake City had two\ncompetitions in 2022, and they have the same name in the dataset. I may go back and fix this.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-6\">\n<p>  Don’t ask me what the endpoints are for “reasonable.” I have no idea. The Meiringen 2018 Women’s final, where the finalists\nreached the top in 20 of their 24 opportunities, was too easy. The Vienna 2011 men’s final and Munich 2010 women’s final,\nwhere finalists reached the top in 2 of their 24 opportunities, were too hard. I don’t know where I’d draw the line for the transition\nfrom “too easy” to “acceptably easy” or “too hard” to “acceptably hard.”</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-6\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-7\">\n<p>and the rest of the <em>really deep</em> women’s field right now</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-7\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Let Janja cook","date":"January 16, 2023","description":"Let Janja Garnbret cook"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Packaging-a-Scala-CLI-app-in-2022/Packaging-a-Scala-CLI-app-in-2022/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Packaging a Scala CLI app in 2022"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"eb390ad3-006a-56e1-b18d-085b9feb3841","previousPostId":"15d39c54-d606-5b57-9912-aa716b2f8de9","nextPostId":null}},
