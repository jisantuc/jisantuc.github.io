I'm a data scientist at Picwell, and this is my personal blog. I mainly use python but sometimes also R. I blog about economics and politics and sports. I focus on what can be said on and learned from the internet, with viz thrown in for flavor. I tweet at [@jisantucci](https://www.twitter.com/jisantucci) and github [@jisantuc](https://www.github.com/jisantuc).

This is me recently:
