title: About

I'm a software engineer.

I'm interested in typed functional programming and programs that can't crash.
For `$work` I often maintain web service interfaces to complicated parts of my job's software. Right now that's
scheduling services at [Umbra](https://umbra.space/) in Python.
In non-_work_ work I like Haskell and its friends, and you can see some past small work in those areas
in [a 2d pointing satellite simulator](https://github.com/jisantuc/schedule-2d-sat-sim/),
[Advent of Code solutions](https://github.com/jisantuc/advent-of-code/tree/main/aoc2021),
and a [tiny library for explaining property-based testing](https://github.com/jisantuc/tiny-test/).

TODO: insert resume I guess?
